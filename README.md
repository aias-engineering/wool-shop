# wool-shop

## Requirements
so what's known until now...

The van der Meulens asked me for support for establishing an online distribution channel for the wool-'business' of Afke.
At the moment they have a phyiscal 'folder' (some kind of catalog, I guess) they give to potentional buyers - but as
new products are made, they need to update the folder many times.

They would like to have a small website  to refer their customers to.
The website should provide:
 * the product catalog to browse through
 * an ordering mechanism
So it's pretty much a small online shop.

Their customers are mainly poeple from
* Jordan
* the Nederlands
* the USA
So payments should be possible in
* Jordanian Dinars
* Euro
* US Dollars

Also, I guess, the site should be multilingual. As one of the languages is arabic,
we need to consider a 'right-to-left' layout.

### Open Points
 * is a user management necessary or are all the orders ad-hoc?
 * what are their thoughts about shipments? international shipping?

## First thoughts about possible User Interfaces
There are of course some pretty straight forward views to define.
* The product catalog page
* (possibly a detail view for the products?)
* An administrative User Interface
  * upload new products
  * see pending orders   
* A checkout screen with payment plugin
